# Predicting_laptop_prices


 Project name: Predicting laptop prices using machine learning

Thank you for looking at our project

An overview of the project: We collected real data, created and trained the model in order
to predict laptop prices based on specific specifications to determine the price of a 
laptop that is not present in the training database.

Authors: Abdul Rahman Al-Saraqbi - Muhammad Humaidan.

Features: We have added a self-development feature to the project. The more this application is used, 
the more training data will increase, and the accuracy of the algorithm will also increase.
